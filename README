Some notes on tasks:

1. Result in 'com.cybervision.HashCodeExample'. All me notes are in the comments
2. Result in 'com.cybervision.User'. I have described everything in the comments
3. For example, you can offer to organize some kind of queue.
   Variants: or a queue of entire test suites or a queue of individual tests.
   The first option: when a request comes for a set of tests - immediately put the entire set in the queue.
   The second option: when the set comes - put only the first test from the set to the queue, and the next one from the set - only when the first is executed.
   Advantages: according to the first option - those kits that have come before - will end sooner,
   by the second option - for short sets, the chance to execute earlier is increased, without waiting for the end of the length.
   You can create multiple instances of a test environment
   or even a pool of test environments.
